BLUETOOTH ERRORS

The solution from this article worked for me:

sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

Then delete the device from bluetooth devices and pair it again.

If it works, you can consider adding the second command to your startup settings, so that you don't have to run it again after every reboot.

If it doesn't work, try restarting pulseaudio:

pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio -D
